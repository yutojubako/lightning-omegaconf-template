<br>

## 📌  Introduction

**Why you might want to use it:**

✅ Save on boilerplate <br>
Easily add new models, datasets, tasks, experiments, and train on different accelerators, like multi-GPU, TPU or SLURM clusters.

✅ Education <br>
Thoroughly commented. You can use this repo as a learning resource.

✅ Reusability <br>
Collection of useful MLOps tools, configs, and code snippets. You can use this repo as a reference for various utilities.

**Why you might not want to use it:**

❌ Things break from time to time <br>
Lightning and OmegaConf are still evolving and integrate many libraries, which means sometimes things break. For the list of currently known problems visit [this page](https://github.com/ashleve/lightning-omegaconf-template/labels/bug).

❌ Not adjusted for data engineering <br>
Template is not really adjusted for building data pipelines that depend on each other. It's more efficient to use it for model prototyping on ready-to-use data.

❌ Overfitted to simple use case <br>
The configuration setup is built with simple lightning training in mind. You might need to put some effort to adjust it for different use cases, e.g. lightning fabric.

❌ Might not support your workflow <br>
For example, you can't resume multi-run or hyperparameter search workflows.

> **Note**: _Keep in mind this is unofficial community project._

</div>

## ⚡  Your Superpowers

OmegaConf makes it easy to keep configuration in YAML while still overriding values from the
command line. This template uses dotlist-style overrides for CLI usage.

```bash
# override a few settings from the command line
python src/train.py --config configs/train.yaml --overrides \
  trainer.max_epochs=20 model.optimizer.lr=1e-4

# enable mixed precision on GPU
python src/train.py --config configs/train.yaml --overrides \
  trainer.accelerator=gpu trainer.devices=1 trainer.precision=16

# run evaluation from a checkpoint
python src/eval.py --config configs/eval.yaml --overrides \
  ckpt_path="/path/to/ckpt/name.ckpt"
```

For more examples, look at the YAML configs in [configs/](configs/) and override only the fields
you need.

Have a question? Found a bug? Missing a specific feature? Feel free to file a new issue, discussion or PR with respective title and description.

Before making an issue, please verify that:

- The problem still exists on the current `main` branch.
- Your python dependencies are updated to recent versions.

Suggestions for improvements are always welcome!

<br>

## How It Works

All PyTorch Lightning modules are dynamically instantiated from module paths specified in config. Example model config:

```yaml
_target_: src.models.mnist_model.MNISTLitModule
lr: 0.001
net:
  _target_: src.models.components.simple_dense_net.SimpleDenseNet
  input_size: 784
  lin1_size: 256
  lin2_size: 256
  lin3_size: 256
  output_size: 10
```

Using this config we can instantiate the object via the helpers in
[`src/utils/instantiators.py`](src/utils/instantiators.py). This allows you to easily iterate
over new models! Every time you create a new one, just specify its module path and parameters
in the appropriate config file. <br>

Switch between models and datamodules by selecting a different YAML under `configs/model/`
and `configs/data/`, or by overriding those fields from the CLI.

Example pipeline managing the instantiation logic: [src/train.py](src/train.py).

<br>

## Main Config

Location: [configs/train.yaml](configs/train.yaml) <br>
Main project config contains default training configuration.<br>
It determines how config is composed when simply executing command
`python src/train.py --config configs/train.yaml`.<br>

<details>
<summary><b>Show main project config</b></summary>

```yaml
# order of defaults determines the order in which configs override each other
defaults:
  - _self_
  - data: mnist.yaml
  - model: mnist.yaml
  - callbacks: default.yaml
  - logger: null # set logger here or override via CLI (e.g. `--overrides logger=csv`)
  - trainer: default.yaml
  - paths: default.yaml
  - extras: default.yaml

  # experiment configs allow for version control of specific hyperparameters
  # e.g. best hyperparameters for given model and datamodule
  - experiment: null

  # optional local config for machine/user specific settings
  # it's optional since it doesn't need to exist and is excluded from version control
  - optional local: default.yaml

  # debugging config (enable through command line, e.g. `--overrides debug=default`)
  - debug: null

# task name, determines output directory path
task_name: "train"

# tags to help you identify your experiments
# you can overwrite this in experiment configs
# overwrite from command line with `--overrides tags="[first_tag, second_tag]"`
tags: ["dev"]

# set False to skip model training
train: True

# evaluate on test set, using best model weights achieved during training
# lightning chooses best weights based on the metric specified in checkpoint callback
test: True

# simply provide checkpoint path to resume training
ckpt_path: null

# seed for random number generators in pytorch, numpy and python.random
seed: null
```

</details>

<br>

## Experiment Config

Location: [configs/experiment](configs/experiment)<br>
Experiment configs allow you to overwrite parameters from main config.<br>
For example, you can use them to version control best hyperparameters for each combination of model and dataset.

<details>
<summary><b>Show example experiment config</b></summary>

```yaml
# to execute this experiment run:
# python src/train.py --config configs/train.yaml --overrides experiment=example

tags: ["mnist", "simple_dense_net"]

seed: 12345

trainer:
  min_epochs: 10
  max_epochs: 10
  gradient_clip_val: 0.5

model:
  optimizer:
    lr: 0.002
  net:
    lin1_size: 128
    lin2_size: 256
    lin3_size: 64

data:
  batch_size: 64

logger:
  wandb:
    tags: ${tags}
    group: "mnist"
```

</details>

<br>

## Workflow

**Basic workflow**

1. Write your PyTorch Lightning module (see [models/mnist_module.py](src/models/mnist_module.py) for example)
2. Write your PyTorch Lightning datamodule (see [data/mnist_datamodule.py](src/data/mnist_datamodule.py) for example)
3. Write your experiment config, containing paths to model and datamodule
4. Run training with chosen experiment config (merge it with the base config):
   ```bash
   python src/train.py --config configs/train.yaml --overrides \
     experiment=experiment_name.yaml
   ```

**Experiment design**

_Say you want to execute many runs to plot how accuracy changes in respect to batch size._

1. Execute the runs with some config parameter that allows you to identify them easily, like
   tags. You can script the repeated runs from a shell script or notebook by varying the
   overrides passed to the CLI:

   ```bash
   python src/train.py --config configs/train.yaml --overrides \
     logger=csv data.batch_size=16 tags=["batch_size_exp"]
   ```

2. Write a script or notebook that searches over the `logs/` folder and retrieves csv logs from runs containing given tags in config. Plot the results.

<br>

## Logs

The training script creates a new output directory for every executed run.

Default logging structure:

```
├── logs
│   ├── task_name
│   │   ├── runs                        # Logs generated by single runs
│   │   │   ├── YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS       # Datetime of the run
│   │   │   │   ├── csv                     # Csv logs
│   │   │   │   ├── wandb                   # Weights&Biases logs
│   │   │   │   ├── checkpoints             # Training checkpoints
│   │   │   │   └── ...                     # Any other thing saved during training
│   │   │   └── ...
│   │   │
│   └── debugs                          # Logs generated when debugging config is attached
│       └── ...
```

</details>

You can change this structure by modifying paths in [configs/paths](configs/paths).

<br>

## Experiment Tracking

PyTorch Lightning supports many popular logging frameworks: [Weights&Biases](https://www.wandb.com/), [Neptune](https://neptune.ai/), [Comet](https://www.comet.ml/), [MLFlow](https://mlflow.org), [Tensorboard](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard/).

These tools help you keep track of hyperparameters and output metrics and allow you to compare and visualize results. To use one of them simply complete its configuration in [configs/logger](configs/logger) and run:

```bash
python src/train.py --config configs/train.yaml --overrides logger=logger_name
```

You can use many of them at once (see [configs/logger/many_loggers.yaml](configs/logger/many_loggers.yaml) for example).

You can also write your own logger.

Lightning provides convenient method for logging custom metrics from inside LightningModule. Read the [docs](https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/latest/extensions/logging.html#automatic-logging) or take a look at [MNIST example](src/models/mnist_module.py).

<br>

## Tests

Template comes with generic tests implemented with `pytest`.

```bash
# run all tests
pytest

# run tests from specific file
pytest tests/test_datamodules.py

# run all tests except the ones marked as slow
pytest -k "not slow"
```

Most of the implemented tests don't check for any specific output - they exist to simply verify that executing some commands doesn't end up in throwing exceptions. You can execute them once in a while to speed up the development.

Currently, the tests cover cases like:

- running 1 train, val and test step
- running 1 epoch on 1% of data, saving ckpt and resuming for the second epoch
- running 2 epochs on 1% of data, with DDP simulated on CPU

And many others. You should be able to modify them easily for your use case.

There is also `@RunIf` decorator implemented, that allows you to run tests only if certain conditions are met, e.g. GPU is available or system is not windows. See the [examples](tests/test_datamodules.py).

<br>


## Continuous Integration

Template comes with CI workflows implemented in Github Actions:

- `.github/workflows/test.yaml`: running all tests with pytest
- `.github/workflows/code-quality-main.yaml`: running pre-commits on main branch for all files
- `.github/workflows/code-quality-pr.yaml`: running pre-commits on pull requests for modified files only

<br>

## Distributed Training

Lightning supports multiple ways of doing distributed training. The most common one is DDP, which spawns separate process for each GPU and averages gradients between them. To learn about other approaches read the [lightning docs](https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/latest/advanced/speed.html).

You can run DDP on mnist example with 4 GPUs like this:

```bash
python src/train.py --config configs/train.yaml --overrides \
  trainer.strategy=ddp trainer.devices=4
```

> **Note**: When using DDP you have to be careful how you write your models - read the [docs](https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/latest/advanced/speed.html).

<br>

## Accessing Datamodule Attributes In Model

The simplest way is to pass datamodule attribute directly to model on initialization:

```python
# ./src/train.py
datamodule = instantiate(config.data)
model = instantiate(config.model, some_param=datamodule.some_param)
```

> **Note**: Not a very robust solution, since it assumes all your datamodules have `some_param` attribute available.

Similarly, you can pass a whole datamodule config as an init parameter:

```python
# ./src/train.py
model = instantiate(config.model, dm_conf=config.data)
```

You can also pass a datamodule config parameter to your model through variable interpolation:

```yaml
# ./configs/model/my_model.yaml
_target_: src.models.my_module.MyLitModule
lr: 0.01
some_param: ${data.some_param}
```

Another approach is to access datamodule in LightningModule directly through Trainer:

```python
# ./src/models/mnist_module.py
def on_train_start(self):
  self.some_param = self.trainer.datamodule.some_param
```

> **Note**: This only works after the training starts since otherwise trainer won't be yet available in LightningModule.

<br>

## Best Practices

<details>
<summary><b>Use Miniconda</b></summary>

It's usually unnecessary to install full anaconda environment, miniconda should be enough (weights around 80MB).

Big advantage of conda is that it allows for installing packages without requiring certain compilers or libraries to be available in the system (since it installs precompiled binaries), so it often makes it easier to install some dependencies e.g. cudatoolkit for GPU support.

It also allows you to access your environments globally which might be more convenient than creating new local environment for every project.

Example installation:

```bash
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

Update conda:

```bash
conda update -n base -c defaults conda
```

Create new conda environment:

```bash
conda create -n myenv python=3.10
conda activate myenv
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Use automatic code formatting</b></summary>

Use pre-commit hooks to standardize code formatting of your project and save mental energy.<br>
Simply install pre-commit package with:

```bash
pip install pre-commit
```

Next, install hooks from [.pre-commit-config.yaml](.pre-commit-config.yaml):

```bash
pre-commit install
```

After that your code will be automatically reformatted on every new commit.

To reformat all files in the project use command:

```bash
pre-commit run -a
```

To update hook versions in [.pre-commit-config.yaml](.pre-commit-config.yaml) use:

```bash
pre-commit autoupdate
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Set private environment variables in .env file</b></summary>

System specific variables (e.g. absolute paths to datasets) should not be under version control or it will result in conflict between different users. Your private keys also shouldn't be versioned since you don't want them to be leaked.<br>

Template contains `.env.example` file, which serves as an example. Create a new file called `.env` (this name is excluded from version control in .gitignore).
You should use it for storing environment variables like this:

```
MY_VAR=/home/user/my_system_path
```

All variables from `.env` are loaded in `train.py` automatically.

OmegaConf allows you to reference any env variable in `.yaml` configs like this:

```yaml
path_to_data: ${oc.env:MY_VAR}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Name metrics using '/' character</b></summary>

Depending on which logger you're using, it's often useful to define metric name with `/` character:

```python
self.log("train/loss", loss)
```

This way loggers will treat your metrics as belonging to different sections, which helps to get them organised in UI.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Use torchmetrics</b></summary>

Use official [torchmetrics](https://github.com/PytorchLightning/metrics) library to ensure proper calculation of metrics. This is especially important for multi-GPU training!

For example, instead of calculating accuracy by yourself, you should use the provided `Accuracy` class like this:

```python
from torchmetrics.classification.accuracy import Accuracy


class LitModel(LightningModule):
    def __init__(self)
        self.train_acc = Accuracy()
        self.val_acc = Accuracy()

    def training_step(self, batch, batch_idx):
        ...
        acc = self.train_acc(predictions, targets)
        self.log("train/acc", acc)
        ...

    def validation_step(self, batch, batch_idx):
        ...
        acc = self.val_acc(predictions, targets)
        self.log("val/acc", acc)
        ...
```

Make sure to use different metric instance for each step to ensure proper value reduction over all GPU processes.

Torchmetrics provides metrics for most use cases, like F1 score or confusion matrix. Read [documentation](https://torchmetrics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#more-reading) for more.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Follow PyTorch Lightning style guide</b></summary>

The style guide is available [here](https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/latest/starter/style_guide.html).<br>

1. Be explicit in your init. Try to define all the relevant defaults so that the user doesn’t have to guess. Provide type hints. This way your module is reusable across projects!

   ```python
   class LitModel(LightningModule):
       def __init__(self, layer_size: int = 256, lr: float = 0.001):
   ```

2. Preserve the recommended method order.

   ```python
   class LitModel(LightningModule):

       def __init__():
           ...

       def forward():
           ...

       def training_step():
           ...

       def training_step_end():
           ...

       def on_train_epoch_end():
           ...

       def validation_step():
           ...

       def validation_step_end():
           ...

       def on_validation_epoch_end():
           ...

       def test_step():
           ...

       def test_step_end():
           ...

       def on_test_epoch_end():
           ...

       def configure_optimizers():
           ...

       def any_extra_hook():
           ...
   ```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Version control your data and models with DVC</b></summary>

Use [DVC](https://dvc.org) to version control big files, like your data or trained ML models.<br>
To initialize the dvc repository:

```bash
dvc init
```

To start tracking a file or directory, use `dvc add`:

```bash
dvc add data/MNIST
```

DVC stores information about the added file (or a directory) in a special .dvc file named data/MNIST.dvc, a small text file with a human-readable format. This file can be easily versioned like source code with Git, as a placeholder for the original data:

```bash
git add data/MNIST.dvc data/.gitignore
git commit -m "Add raw data"
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Support installing project as a package</b></summary>

It allows other people to easily use your modules in their own projects.
Change name of the `src` folder to your project name and complete the `setup.py` file.

Now your project can be installed from local files:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

Or directly from git repository:

```bash
pip install git+git://github.com/YourGithubName/your-repo-name.git --upgrade
```

So any file can be easily imported into any other file like so:

```python
from project_name.models.mnist_module import MNISTLitModule
from project_name.data.mnist_datamodule import MNISTDataModule
```

</details>

<summary><b>Keep local configs out of code versioning</b></summary>

Some configurations are user/machine/installation specific (e.g. configuration of local cluster, or harddrive paths on a specific machine). For such scenarios, a file [configs/local/default.yaml](configs/local/) can be created which is automatically loaded but not tracked by Git.

For example, you can use it to store machine-specific paths and trainer defaults:

```yaml
data_dir: /mnt/scratch/data/
trainer:
  accelerator: gpu
  devices: 1
```

## How to run

Train model with default configuration

```bash
# train on CPU
python src/train.py --config configs/train.yaml --overrides \
  trainer.accelerator=cpu

# train on GPU
python src/train.py --config configs/train.yaml --overrides \
  trainer.accelerator=gpu trainer.devices=1
```

Train model with chosen experiment configuration from [configs/experiment/](configs/experiment/)

```bash
python src/train.py --config configs/train.yaml --overrides \
  experiment=experiment_name.yaml
```

You can override any parameter from command line like this

```bash
python src/train.py --config configs/train.yaml --overrides \
  trainer.max_epochs=20 data.batch_size=64
```
